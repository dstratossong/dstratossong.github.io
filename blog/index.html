<h1 id="blog-of-david-song">Blog of David Song</h1>

<p>I write about stuff that are interesting, stuff I can relate to, stuff that are good to know. Temporarily, this section of the website, <code>blog/</code> is only published using <a href="https://stackedit.io/">StackEdit</a>, and every page (including this index page) is in Markdown format. </p>

<p>This is currently a small blog, with a limited number of posts. Until I better organize this site, and to see more of my writing, I have an old personal blog of <a href="https://thetransitiveaxiom.wordpress.com/">my writings</a></p>

<hr>



<h2 id="posts">Posts</h2>

<p>This site is split into personal posts and engineering posts. The personal part will be more reflective thoughts that I have throughout my journey, where I will be explaining my philosophies and values; the engineering part will be things I have learnt. </p>

<ul>
<li>Personal <br>
<ul><li><a href="why-i-write.html">Why I Write</a></li></ul></li>
<li>Engineering <br>
<ul><li><a href="using-cancancan.html">Using CanCanCan</a></li>
<li><a href="using-docker.html">Using Docker</a></li></ul></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> the engineering posts will assume basic knowledge of the tools/frameworks used. This means that posts will not substitute for a tutorial, but will instead more about filling in the rationale for the particular way of usage. </p>
