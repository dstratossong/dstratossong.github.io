<p>I write about stuff that are interesting, stuff I can relate to, stuff that are good to know.

This site is hosted on GitHub pages, and you can find the sources of each article in <a href="https://github.com/dstratossong/dstratossong.github.io">the repository</a>, under <code>/blog/source/</code>.</p>

<p>Here I will give a thorough walkthrough of some of the design choices I have made. It is most likely that my findings are the result of a long string of research over many other articles and comment threads. I hope only to gather my findings and raise discussion. I would be more than glad if you challenge me. </p>

<p>Note that these posts will assume basic knowledge of the tools/frameworks used. This means that posts will not substitute for a tutorial, but will instead more about filling in the rationale for the particular way of usage. </p>

<p>These are posts where the introspective me will take a more self-reflective tone. These writings will shine light into my personal philosophies and values.</p>

<p>I have an old personal blog of <a href="https://thetransitiveaxiom.wordpress.com/">my writings</a>. They will be slowly transferred here.</p>
