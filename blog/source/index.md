Blog of David Song
==================

I write about stuff that are interesting, stuff I can relate to, stuff that are good to know. Temporarily, this section of the website, `/blog/` is only published using [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/), and every page (including this index page) is in Markdown format. As this site is hosted on GitHub pages, you can find the Markdown sources in this repository, under `/blog/source/`.

### Engineering Posts

Here I will give a thorough walkthrough of some of the design choices I have made. It is most likely that my findings are the result of a long string of research over many other articles and comment threads. I hope only to gather my findings and raise discussion. I would be more than glad if you challenge me. 

Note that these posts will assume basic knowledge of the tools/frameworks used. This means that posts will not substitute for a tutorial, but will instead more about filling in the rationale for the particular way of usage. 

- [Using Docker](using-docker.html) - Rails, Docker
- [Using CanCanCan](using-cancancan.html) - Rails, Permissions, CanCanCan

### Personal Posts

These are posts where the introspective me will take a more self-reflective tone. These writings will shine light into my personal philosophies and values.

I have an old personal blog of [my writings](https://thetransitiveaxiom.wordpress.com/). They will be slowly transferred here.
