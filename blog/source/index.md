Blog of David Song
==================

I write about stuff that are interesting, stuff I can relate to, stuff that are good to know. Temporarily, this section of the website, `blog/` is only published using [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/), and every page (including this index page) is in Markdown format. 

This is currently a small blog, with a limited number of posts. Until I better organize this site, and to see more of my writing, I have an old personal blog of [my writings](https://thetransitiveaxiom.wordpress.com/)
