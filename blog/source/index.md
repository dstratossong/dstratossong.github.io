Blog of David Song
==================

I write about stuff that are interesting, stuff I can relate to, stuff that are good to know. Temporarily, this section of the website, `blog/` is only published using [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/), and every page (including this index page) is in Markdown format. 

This is currently a small blog, with a limited number of posts. Until I better organize this site, and to see more of my writing, I have an old personal blog of [my writings](https://thetransitiveaxiom.wordpress.com/)

This site is split into personal posts and engineering posts. The personal part will be more reflective thoughts that I have throughout my journey, where I will be explaining my philosophies and values; the engineering part will be things I have learnt. 

- Personal
	- [Why I Write](why-i-write.html)
- Engineering
	- [Using CanCanCan](using-cancancan.html)
	- [Using Docker](using-docker.html)

> **Note:** the engineering posts will assume basic knowledge of the tools/frameworks used. This means that posts will not substitute for a tutorial, but will instead more about filling in the rationale for the particular way of usage.
