It was wet in the evening. The sun had already set, 

I was taking a walk down Graylock Parkway at around 8:30pm one day. The sky was covered with gray clouds, and the street glowed with a yellowish light when water reflected the street lights. There was not a lot of cars on the six lane road, separated by a green belt in the middle, and scarcely anyone on the sidewalks. It had rained for a few days then, and it continued to rain a couple of days after that. It began to rain hard the moment I reached my destination, and I began to turn back, whereas before it was just a drizzle. Waiting for the pedestrian light at the intersection, I noticed a woman of about 30 years of age, walking on the adjacent sidewalk, carrying an umbrella. I did not think, when I ran out of house, to bring an umbrella myself. I also did not think to throw on a jacket, as I ran out wearing a t-shirt. As a result, my friend who I had dropped off and I were both wet, and I was cold as well. I had thought while waiting for the light, that I would have no intention of running back home. I was quite tired that day, and I liked the rain.

Ever since I was small, in the city in China, I liked to be soaked in the pouring rain. Running along the sidewalk with my mom, smacked by heavy water droplets, I felt happy, and relieved, and I had fun. Until I would reach home, and my clothes would stick to me and it became hard to walk, and my dad yelling at us saying what if we caught a cold or something. I would then have to take off all those clothes and go take a shower, which back then was a pain for me. This rain, however, was not heavy enough to compare with the cooling rain in China. Nevertheless I decided to take my time walking home, and then thinking about how I would have to take off my clothes and find a place in that little room to dry them all, and take a shower.

Thinking this, the woman had walked a few steps past me, when she said, “Sir.” I turned around and realized she was talking to me. “Please take this.” She opened her bag and threw me an umbrella.

Watching her actions, I saw a few more umbrellas in her bag. I caught the thrown umbrella, and said it was okay. She told me it was not normal, and please take the umbrella, and walked away without looking back at me. I stared at her, and when I finally realized I was still soaking in the rain, that I had forgotten to open the umbrella, and that the light had turned green quite some time ago that it was starting to countdown to red, I crossed and ran to the other side, and glanced over my shoulders to see the woman one last time, and yelled thank you across the street.
