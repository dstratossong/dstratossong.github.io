How I Met Your Mother (HIMYM) ended on March 31st. I caught the big one-hour finale the day after, and I really thought that it was one big April Fool's joke.

It wasn't; I was disappointed. I got over it though. Here's what I think (spoilers):

HIMYM is about stories, and the main one is the tale of Ted Mosby's journey towards meeting the mother of his children. We see a year 2030 version of him, during the intro of every episode, and other times, telling this story to his kids. The show serves as a visualization of this word-of-mouth story to us, the viewers. It does not stop there though. Each scene of the show is a sub-story, and the scenes transitions through narration by future Ted Mosby that addresses to the children in year 2030. Each episode contains morals learned by the gang of five, which Ted Mosby concludes to his kids at the end of every episode. As the future Ted collects (and sometimes misses then later tells) different segments of his journey to find his wife, we see many flashbacks and flash-forwards. This is normal in story-telling. ...

This story-telling theme sets the mood of the show. We feel like we are being told a entertaining story by someone familiar. We also get to know the characters, and there would be very little mystery (aside from Barney's bizarre plans) to each character - we would know exactly how each character's reactions to an incident.

That was why I stayed with the show - I got familiar with the characters. And now I must understand that stories do not always have nice, perfect endings.

Up to the very end last episode of the show, almost every other story has been resolved. Barney and Robin were married and their future is looking bright; Marshall and Lily are having a third child and figured out their next steps; Ted was moving to Chicago which we know is not going to happen. All that is left then is for Ted to meet her, the mother. HIMYM had such a success building up to this story that viewers like us cannot wait to see its finale. We expected it to be magical; we wanted it to warm our hearts; we needed to see it succeed.

But the finale was not any of that. We instead saw the gang part ways,

Optimism and reality, friends.

It turns out that everything that the show was built on, everything that we were expecting, was just optimism doing its work. Ted was the most optimistic guy in New York, looking for his

Robin: How do you do this Ted? How do you sit out here, all night, on the roof, in the cold, and still have faith your pumpkin is going to show up?

Look I know that odds are, the love of my life isn't gonna magically walk through that door in a pumpkin costume at 2:43 in the morning, but it seems as nice a spot as any to just, you know, sit and wait.

Then reality struck: Barney and Robin gets divorced; Barney gets an one-night-stand pregnant; Marshall lives a horrible life in corporate law; the gang is segregated by location barriers. In the very last episode, Carter and Craig successfully breaks the very foundation of

The lesson here is that life will always hit you. The gang met parenthood (maybe not for Robin), and in it comes responsibilities and commitments that takes time away from all the crazy and fun things that the gang lives through.

I expected a perfect ending when I watched the finale, and I got struck with reality. How I Met Your Mother did not have a happy ending, but I must learn that this is more realistic than any other ending.
