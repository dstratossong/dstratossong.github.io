<h1 id="using-docker">Using Docker</h1>

<p><em>September 17th, 2015</em></p>

<hr>

<p>Docker is a container service that encapsulates microservices automates deployment of applications. If unfamiliar with containers, think of them as virtual machines (VMs) that only provide operating system level virtualization (on top of kernel), but unlike VMs, this does not extend to hardware level. At first look, it is a light-weight version of virtual machines. This greatly supports the microservices pattern, which encourages the splitting of a large application into services that communicate through TCP, APIs or a message queue (MQ). Docker also provides a Makefile-like deployment script (called Dockerfile), and its main development is towards clustering containers and optimizing their communication between each other.</p>

<p>We looked towards Docker when we thought of building our own infrastructure on AWS and moved away from Heroku. To dockerize our application, we had to use Docker Compose, previously fig, a tool that as of this writing is not production-ready.</p>

<p>The ideal setup for Docker is to have a single command to build your entire project, and another to start the server. There should be abilities to manipulate the container to run commands, like seeding the database (which shouldn’t be ran every time you deploy!). Additionally, the commands should be the same for deploying remotely. </p>

<p>We will setup the obvious infrastructure by putting the database in a container and the Rails application in another. We will link them so that they can communicate to each other (and taking advantage that Postgres can be accessed over a TCP port). We will see that the host will not be <code>localhost</code>. The linking is where Docker Compose comes in, which implements an almost recursive building process.</p>

<p>To start off, we write a Dockerfile that takes a base image to start from. There are various arguments online suggesting that Ubuntu-based images are not meant to use with Docker. Because many applications are still in the process of adapting to Docker, we encourage you to find your own fit and balance between familiarity and configuration. For reference, see <a href="http://phusion.github.io/baseimage-docker/">baseimage-docker</a>, its <a href="https://blog.phusion.nl/2015/01/20/baseimage-docker-fat-containers-treating-containers-vms/">rationale</a>, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7950326">controversy</a> and <a href="http://blog.tutum.co/2014/12/02/docker-and-s6-my-new-favorite-process-supervisor/">alternative</a>.</p>

<p>We will be using the basic Ruby base image, which is based on Ubuntu (with Debian repository). We also want Docker to cache any updates and gem installations, so we put them all in the build process (not the run process later). </p>



<pre class="prettyprint"><code class=" hljs vala"><span class="hljs-preprocessor"># Dockerfile</span>
<span class="hljs-preprocessor"># Base Image</span>
FROM ruby:<span class="hljs-number">2.1</span><span class="hljs-number">.5</span>

RUN bundle install

<span class="hljs-preprocessor"># Add Files</span>

<p>This file is quite straight forward: we use the Ubuntu-based image, and update it; we make our application directory from root, and make it our working directory. Making the folder our working directory means that any command which we inject inside the container will run here. We then add the Gemfile and install all the bundles. Docker caches this into a new container, and then we add the rest of the application files to the container. Note that Docker cannot cache the <code>ADD</code> command, so we try to leave it as late as possible.</p>

<p>A bug that I had before is that my local Gemfile.lock is not synchronized with the most current Gemfile dependencies. As a result, when a different Gemfile.lock is added to the container, it looks for gem versions that were not previously installed (with only the Gemfile). This causes problems and to fix them, simply ignore the lock: </p>



<pre class="prettyprint"><code class=" hljs cs"><span class="hljs-preprocessor"># .dockerignore</span>
Gemfile.<span class="hljs-keyword">lock</span></code></pre>

<p>Next, we want to configure our compose file. Here, I used a common.yml file as a base, which we will reuse later when creating a different compose file for production. </p>



<pre class="prettyprint"><code class=" hljs livecodeserver"><span class="hljs-comment"># common.yml</span>
postgres:
  image: postgres
web: 
  build: .
  <span class="hljs-command"><span class="hljs-keyword">command</span>: <span class="hljs-title">bundle</span> <span class="hljs-title">exec</span> <span class="hljs-title">rails</span> <span class="hljs-title">server</span> -<span class="hljs-title">p</span> <span class="hljs-title">3000</span> -<span class="hljs-title">b</span> <span class="hljs-string">'0.0.0.0'</span> </span>
  ports: 
    - <span class="hljs-string">"3000:3000"</span></code></pre>



<pre class="prettyprint"><code class=" hljs haml"># docker-compose.yml
db:
  extends:
    file: common.yml
    service: postgres
web:
  environment:
    RAILS_ENV: development
    DATABASE_HOST: db
  extends:
    file: common.yml
    service: web
  volumes:
    -<span class="ruby"> .<span class="hljs-symbol">:/Conjure</span>
</span>  links:
    -<span class="ruby"> db</span></code></pre>

<p>Already, we can start building the application:</p>



<pre class="prettyprint"><code class=" hljs bash">docker-compose build                     <span class="hljs-comment"># build</span></code></pre>

<p>So what exactly does <code>docker-compose build</code> do? Note that we defined a <code>build</code> command in common.yml, which simply points to the current directory. Every other command is configured for running the container. Thus <code>docker-compose build</code> simply translates to <code>docker build .</code>, which runs the commands in the Dockerfile found in the current directory. You will see that Docker first skips the building of the db because it is simply an image (it will be built when ran). Then, Docker follows every instruction in the Dockerfile. </p>

<p>Before running this server, we need to change up the database configuration. Postgres’s host is no longer localhost but db, so we need to configure it that way. To make this application still runnable with traditional methods, we will put it as an environment variable (we set its value inside docker-compose.yml)</p>



<pre class="prettyprint"><code class=" hljs haskell"><span class="hljs-preprocessor"># database.yml</span>
<span class="hljs-title">development</span>: &amp;<span class="hljs-default"><span class="hljs-keyword">default</span></span>
  adapter: postgresql
  encoding: unicode
  pool: <span class="hljs-number">5</span>
  host: &lt;%= <span class="hljs-type">ENV</span>['<span class="hljs-type">DATABASE_HOST'</span>] || <span class="hljs-string">"localhost"</span> %&gt;
  port: <span class="hljs-number">5432</span>

  database: conjure_development
  username: postgres
  password:

<span class="hljs-title">test</span>:
  &lt;&lt;: *<span class="hljs-default"><span class="hljs-keyword">default</span></span>
  database: conjure_test

<span class="hljs-title">production</span>:
  &lt;&lt;: *<span class="hljs-default"><span class="hljs-keyword">default</span></span>
  database: conjure_production
  username: postgres
  password: &lt;%= <span class="hljs-type">ENV</span>['<span class="hljs-type">DATABASE_PASSWORD'</span>] %&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Now we can run (and stop) the application. </p>



<pre class="prettyprint"><code class=" hljs bash">docker-compose up <span class="hljs-operator">-d</span>                     <span class="hljs-comment"># start (daemon)</span>
docker-compose logs                      <span class="hljs-comment"># view output</span>
docker-compose stop                      <span class="hljs-comment"># stop daemons</span></code></pre>

<p>Rails might throw an exception and kill itself when you attempt this, and it might be because the database is not created. Then simply create it by running commands inside the container:</p>



<pre class="prettyprint"><code class=" hljs applescript">docker-compose <span class="hljs-command">run</span> INSTANCE COMMAND      <span class="hljs-comment"># running commands</span>
docker-compose <span class="hljs-command">run</span> web rake db:create    <span class="hljs-comment"># e.g. create database</span>
docker-compose <span class="hljs-command">run</span> web rake db:migrate   <span class="hljs-comment"># e.g. migrate database</span>
docker-compose <span class="hljs-command">run</span> web rake db:seed      <span class="hljs-comment"># e.g. seeding database</span></code></pre>

<p>If the problem is something like “Gem not found”, then remove Gemfile.lock from the local directory. Don’t worry, after rebuilding the container, a new lock will be created. </p>

<p>We might want to connect to the rails console, which is as simple as running a command:</p>



<pre class="prettyprint"><code class=" hljs coffeescript">docker-compose run web rails <span class="hljs-built_in">console</span>     <span class="hljs-comment"># e.g. getting console</span></code></pre>

<p>Docker Machine allows us to deploy to a remote server easily. Here I will simply show the commands.</p>
